        <p> The snowman can‚Äôt exist without snow - so how can he be bringing it ??!! 
        </p>
        <p>This time last Christmas we were looking forward to Alex coming home from Egham and we ended up having a lovely family Christmas.  In fact, Alex decided that she wasn‚Äôt getting what she wanted out of the course or the University and after time at home over Christmas, she took the brave decision to have a gap year and to reapply for September 2024.  In January, she applied for a total of 5 courses at Exeter and Bath!

        <h3>January</h3>
        <p>We managed a trip to Cotehele with mum to see the amazing garland made of dried flowers just before they took it down on 12th night and we made a few trips to the stormy coast of Cornwall as well as to the Start Bay Innüòâ</p>
        <h3>February</h3>
        <p> By the start of February, we were back up to Egham in a hired van to bring Alex home.  The van had some truly disgusting and dubious stains where numerous previous van drivers had placed numerous sweaty crotchesü§Æ Alex found it hard to leave but was reassured by a trip to a quaint old pub in Chertsey followed by a return to a Dartmoor pub on the way back! Within a week we were back on the road again as Dawn had planned a belated birthday trip for her mum.  We went to Lymington where we were surprised to find wild donkeys in the New Forest! February continued to be busy with our traditional trip to see the snowdrops at St Rafael‚Äôs and a trip to stay at Start Bay right on the sea front for Valentines - something we used to do as newlyweds in the 1990s! </p>
        <p> We also said goodbye to the Mazda 6 10 years and said hello to a white epace (called Snowy) whose first main trip was to Brighton, a city we first visited in 1992 and had intended to revisit every leap year day but haven‚Äôt visited since Alex was born!  It hasn‚Äôt changed much and we still enjoyed the Royal Pavilion very much as well as the lanes and Baqueano, an outstanding Argentinian steak house that we discovered by chance!  Dawn was mesmerised by the huge jewellery quarter üòé</p>
        <h3>March</h3>
        <p>At the start of March, Dawn treated her mum to a mother‚Äôs day celebration and was lucky to be treated to a cocktail-heavy mothers day celebration herself by Alex who had settled into being at home and had already received some unconditional offers on the first day that the deadlines for applications closed!!   We were very pleased to be spending more time with her and she joined us at lambing live, humouring Dawn and holding a  new born lamb followed by pie night at the pub (Beef not lamb!!). </p>
        <p>At the end of March we introduced Alex to The Rugglestone Inn at Widecombe  because Dawn had a hunch that she would love their cider and beef pies with extra gravy and stilton.  She did however suggest that they should take the 4wd epace rather than Alex practising driving her little fiat due to a fear of snow.  After much hilarity and disbelief, we set off n the epace but Dawn had the last laugh when she pointed out that people entering the pub were covered in snow.  In fact, we ended up having a somewhat epic ride across Dartmoor in the snow and found out the other customers had stayed over in the pub accommodation! Stuck in a pub!! What‚Äôs not to like?  We were impressed by the epace but almost wished we‚Äôd been stranded too üòÇ.</p>
        <p>Our final evening out in March was a visit to Robertsons in Tavistock where were waited on by Alex in her temporary job! 
        </p>
        <h3>April</h3>
        <p>
            April started with us going to Torquay overnight leaving Alex to host her birthday party. We also had a family birthday party and cooked a Margarita Birthday cake as requested.  
        </p>
        <p>
            We rediscovered the Royal Inn at Horsebridge and had a go at making limoncello which was surprisingly good.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Spring brought more visits to NGS gardens and Dawn fell in love with Lady Penelope, a red MX5 who brought back memories of the old days.
