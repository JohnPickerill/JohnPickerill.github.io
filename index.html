        <p>Presumably a reference to the original connotation rather than a suggestion to hold a Pride march??</p>
        <p>This year has seen us continuing to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary “year”, the replacement of our elderly boiler, Alex coming home and going away again…again..🤣,the birth of our great nephew 😯,a holiday in Barbados ❤️💙, a new wedding ring for Dawn and John achieving an ambition to visit Drake’s Island.</p>
<h3>Winter</h3>
<p>This time last year, we were waiting to meet Alex at the station 
    as she returned from Bath University. 
    We saw out the year visiting Buckland Abbey to see their 
    impressive Viking Christmas and spent a lovely evening 
    with Alex and her boyfriend on New Years’ Day.  
    We squeezed in a very wintery traditional new year trip to the Hoe 
    before taking down the decorations and watching them drive off back to Bath.  
    Alex wasn’t gone for long as she came back down in Mid January to celebrate 
    Dawn’s mum’s 89th birthday and join in a family trip to Minehead.  
    In February we went to The Uncle Tom Cobley Tavern for the first time and 
    enjoyed Wistman’s - a local cider named after the Devon dialect for the Devil.  
    The pub was the starting point of the ill fated journey to Widecombe fair 
    and the participants are buried in the village.  
</p>
<p>
    We also went on our traditional trip to see the snow drops at St Raphael’s where Dawn 
    had originally planned to ask them to bless her new wedding ring (replaced as her 
    fingers..err..grew in size).  
    However the vicar was unwell so instead we contacted the vicar at Chagford, 
    a village that has meant a lot to us over the years.  
    He turned out to be Nick McKinnel the man who married us and blessed the original ring!
    He was delighted to say some words of blessing (on Valentine’s Day❤️) and it was 
    lovely to see him again after thirty years as we discovered ours had been the 
    first wedding he’d carried out in his new role at St Andrews and that he 
    remembered us!  
    He’d gone on to become Bishop of Plymouth and Exeter and then retired to Dartmoor 
    (which seems to be full of retired bishops).  
    It was a lovely day and in a nod to local tradition, 
    we laid a rose inside the church on the tomb of Mary Whiddon, 
    a famous Chagford ghost who was killed on her wedding day and who was the 
    inspiration for Lorna Doone.  
    We spent the night at The Castle in Lydord and it was a lovely memory for our 
    30th anniversary year.
</p>

<p>
    On our return, we found Felix with a hole in his side that was increasing in size 
    and quite alarming but with the advice of our local vet, 
    he was well on the way to healing before our planned trip to Barbados.  
    About a week before, however, Dawn began suffering from a “migraine” and 
    after three days visited the optician who referred her to the eye hospital 
    for immediate laser surgery due to the beginning of a detached retina!! 😱 
</p>

<h3>Spring</h3>

<p>The start of March saw us heading off for our much awaited trip to Barbados and 
    it was everything we had dreamed of! ❤️Actually getting there was quite a challenge 
    with Dawn’s mobility and fatigue but by careful planning of trains, 
    accommodation on the doorstep of the airport, a portable stool and airport assistance, 
    we stumbled off to start our adventure! </p>
<p>There was some drama on the half empty plane as some  drunken holidaymakers in their 
    late 20s decided to use the back part of the plane as their personal Wetherspoons - 
    standing up throughout the flight, drinking large amount of booze and making frequent 
    visits to the toilet to err clear their stomachs and make room for more 😂 
    Unsurprisingly that ended in an arrest on the tarmac by the Barbados police who look 
    surprisingly like the old British Police.  
</p>
<p>We were taken aback by how Barbados is at the same time laid back and yet 
    incredibly respectful and boundaried so that no one steps too far out of line 
    and Dawn was immediately taken to the front of the passport control queue.  
    It was probably the best holiday of our married life!  
    Our hotel faced the sea so we watched every single stunning sunset each evening and 
    could just walk onto the beach.  
</p>
<p>  
    We drove on the small bumpy roads on the LEFT side in a Suzuki jimmy and visited 
    St Nicholas Abbey with its beautiful house, railway, Coastal views and rum distillery 
    (selling spicey pepper rum) where we drank delicious coconut water direct from the 
    shell while the local cats took up residence on Dawn’s lap for a prolonged period. 
    We explored stunning beaches like Carlisle Bay and Bathsheba 
    (reminiscent of North Cornwall), 
    as well as tasting rum at mount Gay Distillery, 
    exploring Harrison’s Cave and Animal Flower Cave and 
    strolling around Hunte’s Gardens and the harbour at Bridgetown.  
    We even visited the fascinating historic George Washington House. 
<p>Best of all was a Sunset Catamaran Cruise where they cooked fresh fish on the boat, 
    provided plenty of alcohol (☺️) and took us swimming in the Caribbean Sea with 
    Turtles and Rays.      
    Due to her personal difficulties, Dawn had to be towed along by a poor young lad 
    (a bit like Anne Widecombe on strictly) but you get the message 😂.  
</p>
<p>
    We enjoyed the many beautiful eateries serving fresh fish, cocktails 
    (often rum based) and the local beer (Banks), as well as visiting Oistins 
    fish festival where we were crammed into the “reggae bus” - 
    (a small Peugeot van that smelled heavily of “herbal cigarettes” 😂 driven somewhat 
    erratically by a driver who was very “relaxed” and played loud reggae)where 
    we balanced two of us on a child sized jump seat to get to the live music and 
    beautiful fish, freshly cooked, washed down with various rum based cocktails 
    and Banks! You get the theme! It was all too soon to come back to reality and 
    it took Dawn about a month to recover but it was the experience of a lifetime 
    and really made our 30th year! ❤️
</p>

<p>
    Whilst we were away, Alex had used our house to have her own holiday and to house and cat sitting while we were away. 
    She left it immaculate for which we were very grateful. 
</p>    
<p> Life back home seemed more mundane. Especially the week with problems at the treatment works 
    where South West Water
    would only supply 2 litres of water per day (not enough to shower or flush the loo)!!
    Alex's 20th birthday was marked by the cats bringing 
    her a very large and thankfully dead rat.
</p>

<h3>Summer</h3>

<p>We spent the Summer cooking on the moors and visiting NGS gardens 
    (including one owned by a lady who had been in our hotel in Barbados) 
    as well as renewing our membership of the beautiful Garden House.  
    For Dawn’s birthday we went out to Salumi in Plymouth and visited Alex in Bath , 
    taking Dawn’s mum so that the whole family could be together.  
    John also managed a trip to Dawn’s favourite place, Westward Ho! 
</p>
<p>
    We were  delighted to catch up with John’s old University friends during a 
    weekend at Bourton -on- the -Water where we visited the motor museum.
</p>
<p>
   June saw us in Yorkshire, 
   learning about all thing ghostly including an evening in York with Richard Felix 
   (from Most Haunted) including the infamous Fleece Inn, Dorian Deathly’s spookology, 
   the York ghost bus, the chocolate museum , 
   a river cruise with boats “dressed” for the gay pride festival 
   and the York cat cafe followed by a visit to Whitby and Scarborough 
   via the moors and the dales. 
   A particular favourite in Scarborough was the “old school “ 
   traditional ice cream parlour whereas in Whitby, 
   the Dracula experience and boat trip past Whitby Abbey were brilliant along 
   with the huge fish and chips and specialist lemon whippy!   
</p>
<p>
    Alex came back down to celebrate Father’s Day by taking John to the pub and for a walk
    on Dartmoor and was down again for his birthday, with the cats duly preenting the 
    now traditional  
    a large dead rat on each occasion ! 
</p>    
<p>
    As the Summer went on we went on a train trip to looe and rode on the speedboat 
    (which Dawn found a bit too much!) and enjoyed the Powderham Motor Show.
</p>    
<p>
    As the flowers fully came in bloom  during the hot Summer, 
    we visited the flower fields in Shropshire.
    The flower fields were incredible with row upon row of brightly coloured petals -
    white, light pink, dark pink, yellow, lilac and blue. 
    - all ready to be harvested and used in natural confetti.  
    People had even made faces in the sunflowers     

</p>
<h3>Autumn</h3>

<p>At the start of September, Dawn was unimpressed by her first foray to see a
    Psychic who gave a show with live readings whereto sprits came through 
    to tell their relatives that they didn’t like their hair or their curtains !!    
</p>

<p>Close to the end of September, we decided to have another try at hiring a touring caravan 
    and this time it was a great success with the exception of the occasion when John had 
    to uncouple it and manually turn it around in a station car park 😂.   
    We started off staying near Stonehenge after collecting the caravan in Wiltshire.  
    In contrast to last year it was almost new with its own pristine kitchen and bathroom 
    so Dawn didn’t even have to use the shower block! 
    We found a lovely cute little pub nearby called The Boot and ate there before moving 
    onto a site behind a pub in Matlock where we met some friends from Ashbourne.  
    For old times’ sake, the next day we managed a visit to the impressive 
    Matlock Illuminations and on the last day we met up with 
    Jonathan and Louise in Eyham (plague village) where we had a lovely lunch and a cup 
    of tea in the pub.  
    We came back home via the same campsite near Stonehenge and spent a last night in 
    the pub with Alex, 
    calling in at Bath for a last stop having lunch with her and her boyfriend 
    on the way home.
</p>

<p>At the start of October, we returned to Hunt’s Cider Festival 
    staying in a huge 8 berth motorhome while Alex and her boyfriend 
    camped next door in a tent.  
    It was a great evening with good music and lots of cider as well as being very close 
    to Rohan’s 21st birthday for which we had baked a cake!  
    We finished by camping on the car park of our favourite pub in Widdecombe 
    and appreciated not having to drive home!  
</p>
<p>    
    Once home, we celebrated our 31st Anniversary at Fletchers restaurant 
    (,much more generous portions than the previous year).   
 </p>   
<p>   
    John decorated the house beautifully for Halloween and we spent a week indulging Dawn’s 
    interests by going to the Witchcraft museum and enjoying Crealy decorated for 
    Halloween with an amazing “haunted hotel”.  
    We went back to see “ An interview with a ghost hunter” in Exeter, 
    attended the live show of “Uncanny” with Danny Robins, 
    carved pumpkins and even went on the Totnes Ghost Walk - 
    a short stroll with the most bored , deadpan, 
    non-creepy guide that you could ever wish to meet.  
    The week finished with a night ghost hunting in Dunster where there were odd smells 
    of gunpowder that came and went in an area that had been a civil war site 😱.  
</p>
<p>December has seen us dealing with various stressful meetings and medical  
    appointments as well as shopping for Christmas with John posing as an angel 
    using the giant illuminated wings in Exeter.  
</p>
<p>John achieved an ambition to visit Drake’s Island .  
    It is somewhat derelict and we were bemused when the boat broke down half way 
    to get there and we were left drifting.  
    However we did enjoy  hearing about the history and hearing the ghost stories.
      We even had another phantom smell of TCP that came and went as soon as it 
      had arrived in an area that used to be used by Doctors to treat soldiers!!    
</p>

<h3>Winter 25</h3>
<p>We are now just finally getting ready for Christmas with a few remaining medical appointments and having paid to replace the obligatory broken boiler right near the end of December.  We have made home made sloe gin,visited Dickensian in Tavistock to buy mistletoe and see the Church filled with decorated trees and have booked in for a few cheeky mini Christmas dinners including a truly gorgeous one at The Royal.  True to form, we still have plans to see Humbug at St Nicholas Priory in Exeter and a last trip to Derbyshire to go on a peak district Haunted Pub Crawl with Richard Felix calling in at Stratford going up and in Bath to see the Wurzels on the way back as well as a final stop off for the last TIPP meeting of the year. We still haven’t eaten all the fejolas!!
</p>


<p>
    We will soon be waiting to welcome Alex back for Christmas.
    So as we finalise our plans for Christmas and come to the end of 2025, 
    it just remains to say
</p>
